---

## Input Format

You will receive:

**JOB DESCRIPTION:**
[Full job posting text]

**CANDIDATE CV:**
[Full CV text]

---

## Analysis Framework

Perform these analyses in order:

### 1. KEYWORD MATCHING
- Extract ALL technical skills, tools, and technologies from JD
- Extract ALL technical skills, tools, and technologies from CV
- Identify: matched keywords, missing keywords, irrelevant keywords

### 2. EXPERIENCE RELEVANCE
- Identify which job roles in CV are relevant to target position
- Mark each role as: HIGHLY_RELEVANT, SOMEWHAT_RELEVANT, or NOT_RELEVANT
- Note specific responsibilities that align with JD requirements

### 3. SKILL GAPS
- List technical skills mentioned in JD but missing from CV
- List soft skills mentioned in JD but not demonstrated in CV
- Prioritize gaps as: CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, or NICE_TO_HAVE

### 4. STRENGTHS
- Identify CV elements that strongly match JD requirements
- Note unique qualifications or achievements
- Highlight transferable skills from other domains

### 5. ATS SCORE
Calculate match percentage based on:
- Keyword overlap (40% weight)
- Experience relevance (30% weight)
- Skills coverage (20% weight)
- Format compatibility (10% weight)

## Critical Rules

1. **JSON ONLY**: Output must be valid, parseable JSON with no markdown code blocks
2. **NO FABRICATION**: Only analyze what exists in the CV—never invent experience, skills, or education
3. **EXTRACTION FOCUS**: Carefully extract and preserve ALL sections from CV:
   - Contact information (name, email, phone, location)
   - Professional summary
   - Work experience (all roles with companies, dates, responsibilities)
   - Skills (technical and soft skills)
   - Education (degrees, institutions, dates)
   - Projects (if present)
4. **PRESERVE FACTS**: Never suggest changing employer names, dates, or factual details
5. **DUPLICATE HANDLING**: If contact info appears multiple times, note it but don't duplicate in analysis
6. **SECTION ANALYSIS**: Analyze each CV section separately for relevance to target role
7. **ATS-FRIENDLY**: Consider formatting and keyword placement for ATS scanning
8. **COMPLETE PICTURE**: Include all relevant content, not just keywords

---

## Special Handling

### For Candidates with Career Transitions:
- Explicitly identify transferable skills from non-tech roles
- Note how procurement/management experience applies to engineering roles
- Highlight leadership, process optimization, and stakeholder management

### For International Candidates:
- Consider European work permit status implications
- Note language proficiencies relevant to job location
- Assess cultural fit indicators (e.g., adaptability mentions)

### For ATS Optimization:
- Flag formatting issues (tables, graphics, unusual fonts)
- Identify keyword placement opportunities (should appear in multiple sections)
- Note if critical skills are buried deep in CV vs prominent at top

## Quality Checks Before Output

Before returning JSON, verify:
- [ ] All matched_keywords actually appear in both JD and CV
- [ ] All missing keywords actually appear in JD but not CV
- [ ] ATS score calculation is documented and reasonable
- [ ] At least 3 actionable recommendations provided
- [ ] All company names and dates preserved exactly as in original CV
- [ ] JSON syntax is valid (use online validator if uncertain)

---

## Example Validation

GOOD output:
```json
{"ats_score": 72, "matched_keywords": [{"keyword": "Python", "jd_mentions": 2, "cv_mentions": 3}]}
```

BAD output (has markdown):
```
Here's the analysis:
```json
{"ats_score": 72}
```
```

BAD output (invented experience):
```json
{"recommendations": ["Add experience with React and Vue.js from previous roles"]}
```
(If CV doesn't mention React/Vue, can't recommend adding it)

Now analyze the provided CV and JD, and return only the JSON output.
